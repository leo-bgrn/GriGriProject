From our first holidays with my friends, we are playing a little dumb game.

An object, not having it is the goal (It is a Happy meal game ðŸ˜‚)

When we have it, we have to give it to someone else. The only rule: the person receiving it must not be aware.

We can put it in a bag, or on the hood, ideas are not lacking.
